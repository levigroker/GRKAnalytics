3.2   - 2018/04/19 @levigroker - Adding user identification flag to enable/disable the
		`identifyUserWithID:andEmailAddress:` method from sending user-identifiable
		information to the individual providers. This flag **disables** the
		`identifyUserWithID:andEmailAddress:` method by default. Previous users of this
		framework should be aware this will break user identification if not explicitly
		enabled. This change is inspired by the
		[GDPR legislation](https://techblog.bozho.net/gdpr-practical-guide-developers/).
		Anyone considering enabling this feature must get the userâ€™s *explicit* consent.
