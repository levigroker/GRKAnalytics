A lightweight abstraction for underlying analytics providers.

### Installing

If you're using [CocoPods](http://cocopods.org) you add the pod to your `Podfile`. Ex:

	pod 'GRKAnalytics'

you will also need to add the desired providers from the `GRKAnalytics` repository to your
project directly. This is because at the time of writing the supplied underlying providers
do not work with CocoaPods `use_frameworks!` directive and therefore must be added
manually.

If you are writing a module which wants to report analytics, but will be consumed by
a larger system which will setup the analytics sytem, you can just directly include only
the API with no providers.

If you are not using CocoaPods, simply add the top level *.m and *.h files, and the
provider(s) you wish from the `Providers` directory to your project and add the
`GRK_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=1` preprocessor directive to your project.

NOTE: You will be responsible for adding the dependent provider library/framework
yourself, as a dependency in your podfile or manually, as the GRKAnalytics podspec does
not bother with third party dependencies. This gives you the freedom to choose the version
and mechanism of import for these dependencies. For example, if you included the
GRKAnalytics providers for `Fabric` and `GoogleAnalytics` you would also need to add the
related pods, like this:

	pod 'Fabric',              '~> 1.6'
	pod 'Crashlytics',         '~> 3.7'
	pod 'GoogleAnalytics',     '~> 3.14'
	pod 'Firebase/Core',       '~> 5.0'
	pod 'GoogleAnalytics',     '~> 3.14'
	pod 'AppCenter/Analytics', '~> 1.14'
	pod 'AppCenter/Crashes',   '~> 1.14'

### Documentation

Configure `GRKAnalytics` with the providers of your choice and call the `GRKAnalytics`
class level methods to identify users, set user properties, track events, time events,
track errors, etc.

	GRKFabricProvider *fabricProvider = [GRKFabricProvider alloc] initWithKits:@[Crashlytics.class]];
	[GRKAnalytics addProvider:fabricProvider];
	//...
	[GRKAnalytics trackEvent:"Hello World"];

The above is the simplest case. Additional documentation is available in the source.

Please note: Firebase does not (yet?) support analytics on macOS.

### Contributing

There are many, many, analytic providers and as such an adaptor to your provider of choice
may not be available in this pod, yet. Writing a provider adaptor is as easy as
subclassing `GRKAnalyticsProvider`, overriding the provider methods you need to make
the appropriate API calls to the underlying provider, and using
`#ifdef GRK_ANALYTICS_ENABLED` blocks to "hide" the provider API usage from Cocoapods.
Take a look at the included provider implementations as examples.

GRKAnalytics only makes use of the underlying provider APIs when the related subspecs are
specified and `GRK_ANALYTICS_ENABLED` is defined, so you'll want to modify the test
application's podfile to include the subspec and the related pod(s) to compile against.

Additionally, for Cocoapods to be happy when validating the spec, the provider classes
must compile without inclusion of the dependent underlying provider APIs. This is where
the provider implementation must use `#ifdef GRK_ANALYTICS_ENABLED` blocks to omit the use
of the underlying providers API from the eyes of the compiler.

Please refer to the included provider implementations for examples of how the
`#ifdef GRK_ANALYTICS_ENABLED` blocks are to be used.

Separately, within the `GRKAnalytics.podspec` you will need to add your provider and add
it to the `all_analytics` array:

    ### Supported Providers
    fabric = { :spec_name => 'Fabric', :provider_class => 'GRKFabricProvider' }
    googleanalytics = { :spec_name => 'GoogleAnalytics', :provider_class => 'GRKGoogleAnalyticsProvider' }
    firebase = { :spec_name => 'Firebase', :provider_class => 'GRKFirebaseProvider' }
	appcenter = { :spec_name => 'AppCenter', :provider_class => 'GRKAppCenterProvider' }

	all_analytics = [fabric, googleanalytics, firebase, appcenter]
    ### 
    
Let's break this down a little...

`fabric`, `googleanalytics`, `firebase`, and `appcenter` are the ruby variable names which
get assigned the associative array with the rest of the information. These names will need
to be added to the `all_analytics` array so the podspec can generate a dynamic description
with the supported providers.

The associative array contains several pieces of data:

`:spec_name => 'Fabric'`  
This is the name of the provider and will be used to generate the pod's dynamic
description.

`:provider_class => 'GRKFabricProvider'`  
This is the name of the `.h` and `.m` files in the `Providers` subdirectory which
represent the class for the provider adaptor. This class should be a subclass of
`GRKAnalyticsProvider`. This is not used by the podspec at this time.

NOTE: At this time the podspec is designed such that all providers are cross-platform
(both iOS and OSX).
